Code to recognize various Sanskrit meters.

All of the hard work was done by the [sanskrit-programmers][thread] group,
especially the [first implementation][impl] by [shreevatsa][shreevatsa].
I've rewritten the code with a more streamlined API, and eventually I may
merge it into the [sanskrit][sanskrit] package.
